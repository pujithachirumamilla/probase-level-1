<p>"Nature photography" overlaps the fields ofâ€”and is sometimes considered an overarching category including -- "wildlife photography," "landscape photography," and "garden photography".
   With nature photography, it's usually best to take a mixture of both close-ups and landscape images. Sweeping landscapes, and close-ups of flora and fauna both make great images, so be sure to look out for hidden opportunities and details while taking nature shots.</p>
